## How it all started

I went to a coding bootcamp in September of 2021 -not knowing how unneeded it was- where i picked up full stack development with a MERN stack. After Attending Hack Reactor I found myself needing more than just a customized Github page and went searching for inspiration. I have a passion for anime, aestheics, and minimalism. Which guided myself with the decsion to re-engineer this site! Hamish Williams is the original creator of this site but i took alot of creative liberties with how i wanted to turn this into a page of my own. Adding my inspiration from other animes such as HxH, .Hack//G.U., and a few that are hidden easter eggs.There's a nod to Hunter X Hunter on my [404 page](/404).
