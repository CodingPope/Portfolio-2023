## How it all started

Back in 2018 I needed to update my portfolio site (as designers are wont to do). I thought I'd steer away from current trends and build a site that tapped into the 80s and 90s Cyberpunk aesthetic. The genre contains some of my favorite movies like Ghost in the Shell (1995), The Matrix (1999), and Akira (1988). That's where I borrowed few visual motifs like the bold katakana lettering on the homepage and the text decoding effect as a homage to the Matrix's "Digital rain" effect, which was itself inspired by Ghost in the Shell's opening credits. There's even a nod to Ghost in the Shell on my [404 page](/404).
