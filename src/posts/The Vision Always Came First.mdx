title: The Vision Always Came First
abstract: A journey of reinvention, intention, and building toward something bigger—from code to community, ideas to execution. This isn’t just what I do. It’s who I am.

## Who I Am (And Why That Matters)

I’m Joe. I’ve always been someone who thought bigger than the moment—_not because I had everything figured out_, but because I knew I had to **build a life that worked for me**.

That meant learning to code. That meant making money. That meant fighting through ADHD, overthinking, ambition, and burnout. That meant breaking out of default settings and designing new ones.

But through all of that—the startup ideas, the tech career, the creative projects—one thing stayed constant:

> I believe in building systems that free people to live better.

Not just software. **Systems.**  
Not just apps. **Experiences.**  
Not just money. **Meaning.**

## What I Do

By day, I’m a software engineer in fintech.  
By night (and weekend, and 2am idea sprints), I’m:

- **Building** [Social Circle](https://joepope.vercel.app/articles/hy-Social-Circle-Exists): A rethinking of how we meet, host, and build circles of real-life connection.
- **Launching** side ventures like Airbnb, YouTube content, and a holding company to tie it all together.
- **Exploring** economic systems beyond scarcity—writing manifestos, testing new models, designing rep-based ecosystems.

But it’s not about the résumé.

The real work is in how I think, how I move, and what I care about:  
Freedom. Simplicity. Legacy. Alignment. Play.

## What I Value

- **Self-direction** over structure
- **Purpose** over status
- **Momentum** over perfection
- **Creating** over consuming
- **Designing** over reacting

I’m not trying to be everything. I’m trying to be _exactly what I’m supposed to be_—and that means being honest about what matters, cutting what doesn’t, and staying in motion.

I don’t want to build million-dollar apps.  
I want to build something that makes people feel **seen**, **connected**, and **capable**.

## How It Started

No shiny origin story. No trust fund. No perfect setup.

Just me—trying to make life feel **less like survival** and **more like art**.

That’s why I write. That’s why I design. That’s why I share. And that’s why I’m building.

## Why I Made This Site

Because I’m not just one thing.

This is a place where all the parts of me get to exist together:  
The engineer. The designer. The thinker. The builder. The human.

If you resonate with that—stick around.  
There’s more coming.
